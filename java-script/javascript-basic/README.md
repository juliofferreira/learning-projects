# JavaScript create dynamic web pages course

Simple project creating a dynamic page where the buttons play audio when clicked.

During this course onclick functions were attributed to button dynamically, depending on their classes. Classes ere added and removed from the button according to the onclick event, to fill the background with the color red on 'space' or 'enter' click.

Some errors, such as null or wrong selector errors, were handled inside the function.
