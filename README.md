# learning-projects

Repository organizing my progress in programming.

Most of the things that I have studied or am studying right now are here. The projects in this repository were made mainly following along courses, self made projects are in their own repositories.

Older files (modified in 20/08/2022) probably won't have a README file, since this repository was created many months after I started studying programming.
